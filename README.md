# NetCadCamn - Network Automation by Design

This repository contains the core framework library for the netcadcam project.

The primary goal of this project is to answer the question:
> How do we know if a network is operating as designed ?

"Network Automation by Design" is the name I am giving to the concept that a
User can:

* Declaratively represent the expected operational state of a network as
a design
</br></br>
* Software systems could automatically generate the collection of
checks, based on the design, so that the User can validate the correctness of
the actual state of the network against the expected state
</br></br>
* The same design can be used to generate the network **device configurations** in
order to achieve the expected operational state
</br></br>
* The same design can be used to generate **business ready documents** that describe
the design in various forms, reports, and diagrams
